    <h1>Rare Disease Club</h1>
    <p>In the Rare Disease Club, our primary objective is to spread awareness about rare diseases, which are often ignored in society. We are committed to educating our community about these diseases and their impact on individuals and families. Additionally, we want to offer resources and support to families who are struggling with the challenges of caring for a loved one with a rare disease. Our club serves the local community including elementary school students, families in need, and local hospitals, as well as our own members. We believe that by working together, we can create a more compassionate and informed society that values the importance of rare disease awareness and advocacy.</p>
